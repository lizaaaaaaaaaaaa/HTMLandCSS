        <b>Peter Pan</b> is a fictional character created by <a href="#">Scottish novelist</a> and playwright <a
            href="#">J. M. Barrie</a>. A free-spirited and mischievous young boy who can fly and never grows up, Peter
        Pan
        spends his never-ending childhood having adventures
        on the mythical island of <a href="#">Neverland</a> as the leader of the <a href="#">Lost Boys</a>, interacting
        with
        <a href="#">fairies</a>, <a href="#">pirates</a>, <a href="#">mermaids</a>, <a href="#">Native Americans</a>,
        and
        occasionally ordinary children from the world outside Neverland.
    </p>
    <p>
        Peter Pan has become a cultural icon symbolizing youthful innocence and <a href="#">escapism</a>. In addition to
        two distinct
        works by Barrie, <a href="#">The Little White Bird</a> (1902, with chapters 13â€“18 published in <a href="#">Peter
        Pan in Kensington Gardens</a> in 1906), and the <a href="#">West End stage</a> play <a href="#">Peter Pan; or,
        the Boy Who Wouldn't Grow
        Up</a> (1904, which expanded into the 1911 novel Peter and Wendy), the character has been featured in a variety
        of media and merchandise, both
        adapting and expanding on Barrie's works. These include several films, television series and many other works.

        Barrie commissioned a <a href="#">statue of Peter Pan</a> by the sculptor <a href="#">George Frampton</a>, which was erected overnight in
    <a href="#">Kensington Gardens</a> on 30 April 1912 as a surprise to the children of London.<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup> Six other statues have been cast
        from the original mould and displayed around the world. In 2002, Peter Pan featured on a <a href="#">series of UK postage
    stamps</a> issued by the <a href="#">Royal Mail</a> on the centenary of Barrie's creation of the character.<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup>
